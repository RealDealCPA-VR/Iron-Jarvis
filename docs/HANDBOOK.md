## What Iron Jarvis is

Iron Jarvis is a **local-first AI operating system** for daily creative,
coding, and office work. One Python daemon owns all state, agents, tools, and
memory on **your machine**; a dashboard renders it; an Electron desktop app
wraps both with a tray, global hotkeys, and auto-updates. Client documents,
chat history, memory, and credentials never leave the box unless *you* connect
a cloud provider — and even then, an unreachable model **refuses and names
itself** rather than silently substituting another one. That honesty rule is
load-bearing everywhere: honest errors beat fabricated output, suggest-don't-act
for anything autonomous, everything reviewable, everything undoable where an
undo can be captured truthfully.

**The three processes**

| Process | What | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Daemon | FastAPI — state, agents, tools, memory, events | `127.0.0.1:8787` |
| Dashboard | Next.js — every page below | `127.0.0.1:8788` |
| Desktop | Electron — tray, hotkeys, updater, Spotlight | wraps both |

**Hotkeys:** `Ctrl+Shift+J` toggles the window, `Ctrl+Shift+Space` opens
Spotlight. State lives in `%APPDATA%/Iron Jarvis/.ironjarvis/` (SQLite DB,
config.toml, secrets vault, skills, backups). Updates download automatically
(checked at boot and every 30 min) and install only when you click
**Restart to update**.

## The surfaces, in the order you'll use them

### Chat — the main surface
Chat is where most work happens, and it is wired into everything:

- **Attachments**: drag-drop or the "+" menu (up to 4 files, 20 MB each).
  Images go to vision; documents are inlined or retrieved via RAG with page
  references, sized to the answering model's context window.
- **Files rail**: every file a conversation *makes or was given* appears on
  the right — preview (spreadsheets as sheets, PDFs and images inline, docx as
  a Word-faithful page), download, open in the native app, save a copy, and a
  **Changes** toggle that diffs a file you re-preview. Truncated previews say
  exactly how much is missing.
- **TurnReceipt**: under each reply — which provider/model actually answered
  and *why* (your pick, the default, a failover), plus the files that turn
  really wrote per the ledger. A mock or failover answer is flagged in amber.
- **Draft cards**: when the model drafts an email, it arrives as a card whose
  **Copy** writes rich text that survives pasting into Outlook (bold, lists,
  links — spacing included, because Outlook renders through Word).
- **"/" skills** anywhere in a message invoke a skill; **@mentions** pull
  agents into a panel bound to the thread; **escalation** hands a chat request
  to a real background agent session when it outgrows a chat turn.
- **Projects (the context spine)**: ground a chat in a project and every turn
  carries the project's folder, knowledge, and recap. File tools then operate
  inside that folder.
- **Compaction**: when a long thread nears the context ceiling, chat *offers*
  a model-written summary of the older messages (you choose); every claim in
  the summary is checked against the ledger before it is trusted.
- **The session namespace**: verbose tools (listings, big reads, shell
  output) can store results as variables (`_store_as`) instead of flooding
  the context; the model reaches them with the `repl` tool. The stored value
  is `{'output': the text, 'data': metadata}`.

### Agents & jobs
- **Post a job** on the Agents page: default target **"Team"** runs a
  supervisor that plans and delegates to specialist agents *in parallel*
  (builder, researcher, reviewer, and your custom agents; a remote agent is
  reached through an honest supervisor bridge). Origin-tagged `job:agents`.
- **Roster**: who can take work, with measured success stats. "Give work"
  posts a job at a specific agent; "Talk" opens a conversation instead.
- **Round table**: persistent multi-agent conversation threads — panelists
  answer in turn and see each other.
- **Custom agents**: author your own (name, prompt, tool list, pinned
  provider/model). **Remote agents**: register an agent running elsewhere
  (URL + bearer token, encrypted at rest; edits never eat the credential).

### Sessions & Kanban
Every agent run is a **session**: live token/tool streaming, the delegation
**TeamTree**, the team's shared **blackboard**, a ledger-derived result card
(files created/changed *proven from the ledger*, never from the model's
closing paragraph), transcript export, cancel/rerun/continue. Kanban shows
the same sessions as lanes — including **Queued** when a concurrency limit is
set. Cancel genuinely stops the agent, in every lane.

### Documents
Read/extract (PDF incl. scanned-with-OCR fallback, docx, xlsx, pptx, csv,
images described), create with real structure (markdown → real headings,
tables, code in docx/pdf/pptx/html; multi-sheet xlsx with formulas), convert
between formats, split/merge/arrange PDFs (originals never modified),
**redact PII** with a scan → confirm → verified-removal flow (the written PDF
is re-read to *prove* the values are gone), batch-process whole folders with
per-document extraction and synthesis, and an Excel engine that can check
formulas by computing them.

### Memory
- **Long-term memory**: markdown bases (Obsidian vault supported), Notion,
  imports from ChatGPT/Claude/Takeout exports, all grounded into chat
  automatically ("# Relevant from memory").
- **Project knowledge**: per-project notes and uploaded documents, embedded
  on write, retrieved on every grounded turn.
- **Memory steward**: a scheduled curator that proposes memory changes for
  your approval — it never silently rewrites what the app knows about you.
- **The 3D memory graph**, lessons, and a "What I can remember" index the
  model sees each turn.

### Automation
- **Schedules**: cron/interval/date tasks that fire real agent sessions
  (project-bound, outcome recorded on the row, delivered to your channels).
- **Workflows**: multi-step (agent/tool/ask/notify steps, parallel groups,
  retries); a run parks on an *ask* step and waits for your answer — from the
  chat card or the Workflows page.
- **Reflexes**: webhook-triggered actions. **Sentinels**: watched folders.
  **Autonomy**: off by default; when on, starts at *suggest* level with hard
  daily action/token caps and a kill switch.
- **Channels**: desktop notifications, Slack, Telegram (chat-id
  auto-detect), email — with per-destination event routing.

### Terminals, Creative, and the rest
Free-form terminal canvas with AI assist per pane; a Creative gallery for
generated media (Pixio); Skills (yours + auto-suggested from successful
sessions, approval-gated); Connections (providers/health); Usage (token
costs); Activity (the full undo-capable action ledger); the **/you** page
(your profile, personas, accessibility presets — injected into every prompt
seam); Train (teach it your writing voice, suggest-only).

## The trust model (why you can rely on it)

1. **Ledger truth.** Every tool call is recorded; session results and file
   claims are derived from the ledger, and a reply that claims a file it
   never wrote is called out under the reply itself.
2. **Real undo.** Reversible mutations capture the prior bytes *before* the
   write; undo restores or removes exactly what changed, refuses when the
   target changed since, and **never fabricates an inverse** — if a capture
   failed, the action is honestly not undoable.
3. **No silent substitution.** A dead provider refuses by name. Mock output
   only ever appears on a fresh install that hasn't connected anything.
4. **Fenced untrusted content.** Web pages, file text, MCP results, and
   agent replies are injection-fenced before a model sees them.
5. **Confined writes.** File tools and the REPL write inside the workspace
   (your project's folder when grounded); reads are policy-gated; protected
   paths (the vault, the DB) are refused both ways.
6. **One event loop, never blocked.** Heavy work runs off-thread — a big
   render or a cold OneDrive folder can't freeze the app.

## Troubleshooting in one minute

- **"Daemon offline"** → almost always a provider/endpoint issue, not the
  daemon: check Connections. The tray can restart both processes.
- **A model "isn't answering"** → read the TurnReceipt: it names what ran and
  why. A red PreflightNote above the composer means your pick is unreachable
  *before* you type.
- **An update seems stuck** → Updates page; a release can take ~10 min to
  finish uploading after the version bumps.
- **Something wrote the wrong thing** → Activity page (or the file's row in
  chat) → Undo. Session-level revert exists for whole runs.
